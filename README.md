instruments/<instrument_name>/

Be sure to use proper commenting wherever possible and keep care of identation

Remeber to name you instruments html as css as <instrument_name>.html and <instrument_name>.css

Q) WAIT, HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROJECT ?
A-> Everyone will work on their separate instruments. No messing with the files of other instruments!

Remeber you have to use 24(8 x 3) keys in total, i.e, 3 octets. No need to worry about the sound, I'll arrange it later.
For the time being, use the sample sound set I provided in whatsapp and use those to test you keys.

Your key layout is

Q W E R T Y U I <-- 1st Octet
A S D F G H J K <-- 2nd Octet
Z X C V B N M < <-- 3rd Octet

There are the 8 instruments that we will be simulating:

1. Basic Drum Kit
2. Acoustic Guitar
3. Banjo
4. Grand Piano
5. Xylophone
6. Sitar
7. Bagpipe
8. Flute

GOOD LUCK!
